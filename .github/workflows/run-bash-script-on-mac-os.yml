      #   # Homebrew is pre-installed on the GitHub Actions MacOS Runner (Virtual Machine) - see: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-12-Readme.md#:~:text=Composer%202.5.5-,Homebrew%204.0.15,-Miniconda%2023.3.1
      #   # - So we need to remove it
      #   # Uninstalling Homebrew using the following command recommended in the docs doesn't fail, but doesn't remove everything it should do due to not having sudo permissions:
      #   # NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
      #   # - So we need to use sudo to run it
      # - name: Uninstall pre-installed Homebrew version
      #   run: |
      #     curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh
      #     chmod +x ./uninstall.sh
      #     sudo ./uninstall.sh --force
      # - name: Remove remaining pre-installed Homebrew directories that weren't removed
      #   # The Homebrew output tells us that these files possibly related to Homebrew on the GitHub Actions MacOS Runner haven't been deleted, so we should remove them:
      #   run: |
      #     sudo rm -rf /usr/local/.com.apple.installer.keep
      #     sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Frameworks/

      # - name: Ensure reportedly deleted pre-installed Homebrew directories no longer exist
      #   # The Homebrew output tells us that these should have been deleted, but we should make sure that they are definitely removed:
      #   run: |
      #     sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Caskroom

      # - name: Ensure pre-installed Homebrew version has been removed
      #   # Check if Homebrew is installed using `command -v brew`. If Homebrew is not already installed, this command will not print anything to standard error or standard output.
      #   # If Homebrew is already installed (if anything is printed to standard error or standard output), print a message stating that the GitHub Workflow needs to be changed to ensure that Homebrew is not already installed on the macOS virtual machine, and fail the GitHub Workflow.
      #   run: |
      #     if command -v brew &> /dev/null
      #       then echo 'Homebrew is still installed but it should have been removed. Uninstall Homebrew to ensure that the bash script does not try to install Homebrew for a second time.'
